# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want PriceSentinel to be a safe, welcoming, and productive environment for anyone who reads, uses, or contributes to this project.

In the interest of fostering an open and inclusive community, we pledge to make participation a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of:

- age, body size, visible or invisible disability
- ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression
- level of experience, education, socio‑economic status
- nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community and the project
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others’ private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Any other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject:

- comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or
- temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within:

- the project repository and associated tooling,
- issue trackers and pull requests,
- documentation and discussions, and
- any other project‑related communication channels set up by the maintainer(s).

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by:

- opening a confidential issue (if appropriate), or
- contacting the maintainer directly at: **joaosoarex@gmail.com**.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated in a way that is appropriate to the circumstances. The project will maintain confidentiality to the extent that it is compatible with resolving the incident and applicable law.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good faith may be permanently removed from the project team.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from widely used open‑source community guidelines (including the Contributor Covenant) and simplified to fit the needs of this project.
